<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">We test the conditional consumption-CAPM using asset holders' consumption and find that the time variation in the prices of asset holders' consumption risk is procyclical. This puzzling time variation is at odds with the implication of existing consumption-based equilibrium asset pricing models. We show that our finding is a salient feature of the data observed in multiple asset classes (aggregate equity market, equity portfolios, bond portfolios, and commodities portfolios), using different measures of consumption (household survey data and high-frequency retail shopping data) and alternative empirical methodologies.</span></span>

The estimated risk-aversion coefficient is lower when we use the consumption growth of wealthy households over a longer horizon as a risk factor, and a model with a 20-quarter horizon yields a risk-aversion coefficient of 15, a value similar to the one estimated from equity portfolios.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">We develop 50 indices of State-level Economic Policy Uncertainty (SEPU) based on newspaper coverage frequency using 204 million newspaper articles from March 1984 to December 2019. We assess the validity of our measures. Our SEPU indices vary counter-cyclically with respect to state-specific economic conditions, rise before close gubernatorial elections, and exhibit a large cross-sectional variation. We demonstrate that SEPU indices are associated with the cross-sectional variation in state-level GDP, employment, income as well as industry investment decisions. Our findings highlight the importance of economic policy uncertainty at the state level in addition to the nationwide level.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">We develop a dynamic capital structure model to study how agency conflicts between managers and shareholders affect the joint determination of financing and investment decisions. We show that there are two agency conflicts with opposing effects on a manager’s choice of investment: first, the consumption of private benefits channel leads managers not only to choose a lower optimal leverage, but also to underinvest, and second, compensation linked to firm size may lead managers to overinvest. We fit the model to the data and show that the average firm slightly overinvests, younger CEOs invest more than older ones, while CEOs with longer tenure overinvest more than CEOs with shorter tenure.</span></span>

<details>
 <summary> <span style="font-size:12pt">Abstract </span> </summary>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">We survey 2,548 representative U.S. respondents to estimate subjective risk-return trade-offs in savings, government bonds, stocks, real estate, gold, and cryptocurrencies. We document a robust negative relationship between respondents’ perceptions of the risk and return among risky assets, which is universal even for wealthy respondents. Asset-specific pessimism explains this negative risk-return relationship by driving up the subjective risk and driving down the expected return simultaneously. Bearish respondents perceive a negative risk-return relationship. In contrast, bullish respondents perceive a positive risk-return relationship. Negative risk-return trade-offs translate into under-diversified portfolios, as investors disproportionately avoid exposure to assets that they are bearish about.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">By leveraging US state-level employment protection laws, we provide evidence that such laws increase stock market participation, on both intensive and extensive margins. Young, low-income, low-wealth, and less-educated households exhibit stronger effects. Conversely, when the protection law is reversed, we observe contrasting financial risk-taking behaviors. Our findings remain robust across various stock market participation measures, datasets, and stacked difference-in-differences research design, underscoring the significance of employment protection in encouraging households to take financial risks, and potentially enhancing wealth accumulation. This represents a novel avenue through which employment protection can benefit households.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">This paper studies a novel channel through which climate risks affect households&rsquo; choices of risky asset allocation: a stringent climate change regulation elevates labor income risk for households employed by high-emission industries which in turn discourages households&#39; financial risk-taking. Using staggered adoptions of climate change action plans across states, we find that climate change action plans lead to a reduction in the share of risky assets by 15% for households in high-emission industries. We also find a reduction in risky asset holdings after the stringent EPA regulation. These results are stronger with experiences of climate change-related disasters. Our study implies an unintended consequence of climate regulations for wealth inequality by discouraging low-wealth households&#39; financial risk-taking.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">We develop a dynamic equilibrium model where heterogeneous investors endogenously choose to enter/exit the stock market. We characterize the equilibrium and present a conditional consumption&nbsp;CAPM. The model implies small changes in the composition of stockholders, which generate a strongly countercyclical stockholders&rsquo; amount of consumption risk. The model provides a new perspective on the main drivers of asset dynamics. It is the procyclical consumption risk-sharing implied by changes in stockholders&#39; composition that contribute to the dynamics of risk premium, excess volatility, and price-dividend ratio. We provide empirical evidence on market participation, amount of risk, and price of risk, supporting our theory. </span></span>
